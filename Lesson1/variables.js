var george = "This pretzels making me thirsty" 

console.log(george);

//  This is an example used in Google console to show how variables work.

// // prompt() receives the response from the user and stores it in a variable.

// // 
// var firstnumber = prompt("enter the first number");
// var secondnumber = prompt( "Enter the second number");
// var sum = Number(firstnumber) + Number(secondnumber);
// alert("The total of these numbers is " + sum);
// // 


//  Undefined is the type of variable that is not deifned.
var x;  // x is an undefined variable because there is no value assigned to it yet
var password; // password is also an undefined variable
