// There are a few features added in 2022 


// .at method for arrays and strings


//example: 


const array = [1, 5, 9, 7, 12];



console.log(array.at(-1));
// Goives you the last element or any element depending on the index input in the .at method.



// TOP level awTAIT is now allowed in modules without
//  the need for an async function. This means you can use await at the top 
// level of your code without wrapping it in an async function.
